    "# Inspect - an Eval Framework\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "- We've seen that prompts can greatly have an impact on the output.\n",
    "- Therefore we need tests to make sure everything keeps working as expecting.\n",
    "- In AI Engineering , test are called `evals`.\n",
    "- If you are not doing tests , you are doing `vibe check` (hence vibe coding)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There exist many eval frameworks (langfuse, Arize, Weights and Biases)\n",
    "- The framework we will use here is `Inspect AI` - <https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/>. \n",
    "- It comes in the form of a VSCode plugin too, this is enabled for this workshop.\n",
    "- It is very well documented and also is easy to run without server interaction (all locally)\n",
    "- But can easily run on a CI/CD server\n",
    "- It has native support for docker/containers making it easy to run code in a sandboxed way."
