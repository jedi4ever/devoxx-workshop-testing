      "2. **Keep your code DRY**: Avoid repetition by storing reusable code in functions or modules.\n",
      "3. **Use strict mode**: This can help in identifying potential issues in your code by enforcing stricter parsing and error handling (`'use strict';`).\n",
      "4. **Use comments wisely**: Comment on complex or non-intuitive code. Avoid over-commenting, allowing the code to be self-explanatory as much as possible.\n",
      "5. **Consistent formatting**: Maintain consistency in indentation, spacing, and naming conventions to improve code readability.\n",
      "6. **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling, especially for asynchronous operations.\n",
      "7. **Avoid global variables**: Limit the use of global variables to reduce the risk of name conflicts and unintended behaviors.\n",
      "8. **Optimize performance**: Be cautious with resource-intensive operations, particularly in loops or deep recursive functions.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Content Comparison**: The expert answer states that the generated code should have the filename \"hello-world.js\". The submitted answer indeed creates a JavaScript file named \"hello-world.js\" that contains a program. Thus, the filename requirement aligns with the expert's guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **File Creation Confirmation**: The expert answer implies that checking whether the file was successfully created is essential. The submitted answer does not explicitly mention checking for successful file creation. Instead, it states that the file was created successfully. While it implies successful creation, it does not technically fulfill the instruction to check for it clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Best Practices Summary**: The expert answer suggests searching for best practices in JavaScript programming but does not provide specific best practices itself. The submitted answer, however, includes a detailed summary of best practices. This goes beyond what the expert provided and aligns with the request to summarize best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Overall Evaluation**: Although the submitted answer provides a program and an outline of best practices, it does not directly confirm that a check for file creation was performed. This is a crucial aspect of the expert response, and its absence leads to a partial fulfillment of the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this detailed examination, the submitted response partially meets the expectations set by the expert's answer. The absence of a clear mention of checking file creation affects the overall correctness of the submission.\n",

      "In conclusion, since the submission does not meet the complete requirements stated in the expert answer (particularly in checking file creation), I will assign an 'I' grade for incorrect answers.\n",
