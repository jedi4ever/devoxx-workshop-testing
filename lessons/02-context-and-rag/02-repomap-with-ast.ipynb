    "Some notes from `Aider` further optimizing the map:\n",
    "> Of course, for large repositories even just the repo map might be too large for GPT’s context window. Aider solves this problem by sending just the most relevant portions of the repo map. It does this by analyzing the full repo map using a graph ranking algorithm, computed on a graph where each source file is a node and edges connect files which have dependencies. Aider optimizes the repo map by selecting the most important parts of the codebase which will fit into the token budget assigned by the user (via the --map-tokens switch, which defaults to 1k tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sample map shown above doesn’t contain every class, method and function from those files. It only includes the most important identifiers, the ones which are most often referenced by other portions of the code. These are the key pieces of context that GPT needs to know to understand the overall codebase.\n",
